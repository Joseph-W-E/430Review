    * In the 'exam/examples_with_errors' directory there is a class SwingClientUnfinished in which the
    * event thread is blocked during the network access. You can run hw1.SimpleServer and try it out
    * (enter a number in the text box). Fix it so that it uses an auxiliary thread to do the network access.
