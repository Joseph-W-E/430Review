    * Modify the sample solution to hw3.syntaxtree.SyntaxTreeManager as follows:
    * get rid of the ad hoc class SyntaxTreeHolder that is being used as a future,
    * and instead use an instance of FutureTask. Note that in this case you should
    * probably NOT use an Executor, because you don't want to add additional threads
    * into the system.
