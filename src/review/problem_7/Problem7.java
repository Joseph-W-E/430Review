    /*
    * In the 'examples/week4' directory, there is a file BoundedBuffer.java.
    * This is a correct implementation of a bounded blocking queue.
    * Suppose we add the method:
    *
    * public T peek() {
    *   if (count == 0)
    *       throw new NoSuchElementException();
    *   return elements[getIndex];
    * }
    *
    * a) Describe two distinct ways in which this code fails.
    * b) What if the variable count was declared volatile?
